Its also a great place in that it's a steakhouse but it also has other items, great for couples where one enjoys a good steak and the other is less of a carnivore!\\n\\nThe service was great and the hostess immediately asked if it was our first time or if we were celebrating something special. Yes to the first, no to the second. But that information was clearly passed on, as our waited and a manager-type both acknowledged that we had not been in before and took the time to explain the menu/food/ect. So there is a long line of communication going on between employees and that's a good thing. \\n\\nNow to the food: \\n\\nShort-rib grilled cheese - Order it! Just do it. It comes with thick bread, egg battered and then grilled with tender, savory short-rib meat, gruyere cheese and white cheddar. It's savory, flavorful and filling. \\n\\nRibeye - I'm not much of a steak eater, but I enjoyed the seasoning and flavors of this steak and the way it was cooked. \\n\\nGarlic Chips - come with each entree and are the classic home-made style of kettle cooked potato chips. They are salty and garlicky and good. \\n\\nMac and cheese - pretty standard. Creamy with breadcrumbs on the top. Not the best mac and cheese you've ever had, but still good. \\n\\nBrocillini - pretty basic, but good. \\n\\nLamb cigars - almost like an eggroll, but with lamb filling. Unique but worth trying. I could have done with out the wrapping and just had the strips of meat, but the eggroll aspect did give it a unique flavor and style that I haven't had before. \\n\\nBaked brie - I'd probably skip next time. I love cheeses but this brie did not have much flavor and the bread was over cooked. Just wasn't my favorite. \\n\\nEach of those items plus a bottle of wine and the bill was about $150 which is a nice price when you compare it to what you would pay at a steakhouse on the Strip. The menu is large enough that you could go back several times and never order the same thing. The service was great, food was high quality and well prepared and the atmosphere was nice.</td>\n",

The food is not bad, but not too memorable either. I've been here a couple times before for brunch. The reason I go for brunch here is not because of the food, but because they have bottomless mimosas (for $16. Bottomless bloody mary for $22) and they're not stingy with the champagne :) Also, the place is nice and easily accessible, so it makes a good place to meet up with friends. I tried their short rib hash and steakhouse scramble for brunch. Both were ok. Not special enough for me to want to order again. I do really like their portobello fries! \\n\\nFor my friend's birthday dinner, I shared a 48 Oz. tomahawk steak with 3 other people. I think the steak was cooked a bit too charred on the outside, but the inside was a nice medium. However, the steak was bland and not tender. It was so bland that I had to eat it with a sauce. I recommend the brandied mushroom and the red wine demi (they offer 7 different sauces). The fact that I had to eat the steak with a sauce is quite sad. To me, a sign of a good steak is when you can eat it by itself and you can savor that juicy meaty taste alone, not covered by some sauces. For sides, I tried the cauliflower (this is good), brussels sprouts (just ok), and mashes potatoes (again, just ok). I also tried the steak tartare for appetizer. Nothing wrong with it, but I've had better. Service was kind of on the slow side that night. \\n\\nSide notes: you can bring your own bottles of wine and they don't charge a corkage fee. If you have a big party, they automatically add a 20% tip. \\n\\nOverall, this is a nice place away from the strip to have some drinks and appetizers (portobello fries!). If you're looking for a good steak though, there are other local places that offer better tasting steaks.</td>\n",

I could be eating a frozen chicken drumstick in an NYC subway stop and have the most awesomest time ever. \\n\\nOther than great company, the food is also pretty good. I love a good off the strip steakhouse.\\n\\nThey used to have this gazpacho that is just ridiculous. It's off of the menu now. I recently \\ne-mailed the GM asking for the recipe and they gave it to us! My love and I had an amazing time preparing it at home. Got loaded on some first class whites and enjoyed this amazing, cold and crisp treat. Just perfect. Thank you guys so so much!! I made two gallons of it, probably. Gazpacho for days, people.\\n\\nThe fried spinach salad is pretty amazing. Great texture paired with tangy and sweet Asian vinaigrette.\\n\\nThe grits and pork belly is just amazing. My steak was as pretty damn good too. Everything was lovely except the ceviche.... Interesting flavor, off putting color.

They sit you down and get your order and everything seems fine. And then you wait.\\n\\nOver 45 minutes later, without a peep from our waitress to check in and let us know what is going, then dump food on our table. I say \"dump\" because we had ordered several courses - soups, salad and main dishes and side dishes andmost of it came out at once...other than the soup and a veggie dish, which we then had to wait another 15 minutes for.  How the heck does the soup come out last?! The worst part about it is that most of the dishes were cold. \\n\\nRather than serving us dishes as they were ready, it was obvious they waited or forgot about our order for a very long time.\\n\\nWe mentioned our frustration to the waitress in a nice way and she said the kitchen was backed up. Then management pops up while we are still waiting for some of our food and asking how is everything.  We mention having some issues with the wait and he makes a snarky comment rather than apologizing or trying to make things a bit better. We weren't at all rude but he handled it all very badly. \\n\\nI think the popularity of the restaurant has made management think that it's ok to treat people badly and that they can afford to lose a few customers. I was appalled and will never go back.\\n\\nIt was one of the worst evenings we've had in a long time.

       "      <td>So I went here on a date recently.. the atmosphere was perfect for a romantic date! the host was very friendly and sweet. We walked up the stairs to a nice table by the windows. its far enough from other tables that you feel like you can have a nice conversation with the person you're with. The overall feel of the place is classy yet relaxing feel to it as well. The waiter we got was very attentive and was awesome. He was an older bald gentleman.. don't remember his name though. He seemed like he worked there for a while and knows his stuff. My date brought a couple of bottle of wines and the waiter was awesome at making sure the wine was poured into the glass decanter to bring out the flavor of the wine and he even poured it back into the bottle when we couldn't finish it all before we left. Service was amazing! top notch\\n\\nSo for starters we ordered the bone marrow carne asada.. my dates favorite dish! It was alright for me.. we also had Maryland lump crab cake as well.. which was tasty but nothing amazing. Just a normal crab cake. \\n\\nSo for dinner my date ordered the ribeye cap for $30 and I ordered the bavette which is supposed to be american kobe.. for $28. Price point for steaks is not bad.. the sauces they have for the steaks are pretty tasty too! So.. as far as my steak goes.. I was expecting a soft filet type of kobe steak... the steak I got was on the chewy side and definitely can't be cut with a fork.. I was not blown away by this steak.. I was expecting a better tasting steak with a better cut for what it was... maybe I should have ordered a the ribeye cap??.. which might of been more flavorful.. we also ordered sides too.. the mac and cheese.. was so good! as well as broccolini i believe... \\n\\nOverall.. I would like to come back again.. this is a perfect date spot or a nice restaurant to come to with friends.. Service is great.. and food is good. I would recommend!</td>\n",

       "6418  One of the best things about this place is the pricing compared to steakhouses on the on the Strip. Its also a great place in that it's a steakhouse but it also has other items, great for couples where one enjoys a good steak and the other is less of a carnivore!\\n\\nThe service was great and the hostess immediately asked if it was our first time or if we were celebrating something special. Yes to the first, no to the second. But that information was clearly passed on, as our waited and a manager-type both acknowledged that we had not been in before and took the time to explain the menu/food/ect. So there is a long line of communication going on between employees and that's a good thing. \\n\\nNow to the food: \\n\\nShort-rib grilled cheese - Order it! Just do it. It comes with thick bread, egg battered and then grilled with tender, savory short-rib meat, gruyere cheese and white cheddar. It's savory, flavorful and filling. \\n\\nRibeye - I'm not much of a steak eater, but I enjoyed the seasoning and flavors of this steak and the way it was cooked. \\n\\nGarlic Chips - come with each entree and are the classic home-made style of kettle cooked potato chips. They are salty and garlicky and good. \\n\\nMac and cheese - pretty standard. Creamy with breadcrumbs on the top. Not the best mac and cheese you've ever had, but still good. \\n\\nBrocillini - pretty basic, but good. \\n\\nLamb cigars - almost like an eggroll, but with lamb filling. Unique but worth trying. I could have done with out the wrapping and just had the strips of meat, but the eggroll aspect did give it a unique flavor and style that I haven't had before. \\n\\nBaked brie - I'd probably skip next time. I love cheeses but this brie did not have much flavor and the bread was over cooked. Just wasn't my favorite. \\n\\nEach of those items plus a bottle of wine and the bill was about $150 which is a nice price when you compare it to what you would pay at a steakhouse on the Strip. The menu is large enough that you could go back several times and never order the same thing. The service was great, food was high quality and well prepared and the atmosphere was nice.   \n",
       "8700                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I most recently went here for dinner to celebrate my friend's birthday. This is one of those restaurants that is just ok. An average restaurant. The food is not bad, but not too memorable either. I've been here a couple times before for brunch. The reason I go for brunch here is not because of the food, but because they have bottomless mimosas (for $16. Bottomless bloody mary for $22) and they're not stingy with the champagne :) Also, the place is nice and easily accessible, so it makes a good place to meet up with friends. I tried their short rib hash and steakhouse scramble for brunch. Both were ok. Not special enough for me to want to order again. I do really like their portobello fries! \\n\\nFor my friend's birthday dinner, I shared a 48 Oz. tomahawk steak with 3 other people. I think the steak was cooked a bit too charred on the outside, but the inside was a nice medium. However, the steak was bland and not tender. It was so bland that I had to eat it with a sauce. I recommend the brandied mushroom and the red wine demi (they offer 7 different sauces). The fact that I had to eat the steak with a sauce is quite sad. To me, a sign of a good steak is when you can eat it by itself and you can savor that juicy meaty taste alone, not covered by some sauces. For sides, I tried the cauliflower (this is good), brussels sprouts (just ok), and mashes potatoes (again, just ok). I also tried the steak tartare for appetizer. Nothing wrong with it, but I've had better. Service was kind of on the slow side that night. \\n\\nSide notes: you can bring your own bottles of wine and they don't charge a corkage fee. If you have a big party, they automatically add a 20% tip. \\n\\nOverall, this is a nice place away from the strip to have some drinks and appetizers (portobello fries!). If you're looking for a good steak though, there are other local places that offer better tasting steaks.   \n",

First time, mainly because I was with my two awesome girlfriends I have not seen in years and we always manage to order the best dishes together and have a blast. \\n\\nOther two times were with my man and the dog and well.. I could be eating a frozen chicken drumstick in an NYC subway stop and have the most awesomest time ever. \\n\\nOther than great company, the food is also pretty good. I love a good off the strip steakhouse.\\n\\nThey used to have this gazpacho that is just ridiculous. It's off of the menu now. I recently \\ne-mailed the GM asking for the recipe and they gave it to us! My love and I had an amazing time preparing it at home. Got loaded on some first class whites and enjoyed this amazing, cold and crisp treat. Just perfect. Thank you guys so so much!! I made two gallons of it, probably. Gazpacho for days, people.\\n\\nThe fried spinach salad is pretty amazing. Great texture paired with tangy and sweet Asian vinaigrette.\\n\\nThe grits and pork belly is just amazing. My steak was as pretty damn good too. Everything was lovely except the ceviche.... Interesting flavor, off putting color. Did not care for it, but only because I was craving the traditional chopped shrimp, onion, cilantro, lime situation. \\n\\nSit on the patio, the evening and nightfall are great :-)   \n",

They sit you down and get your order and everything seems fine. And then you wait.\\n\\nOver 45 minutes later, without a peep from our waitress to check in and let us know what is going, then dump food on our table. I say \"dump\" because we had ordered several courses - soups, salad and main dishes and side dishes andmost of it came out at once...other than the soup and a veggie dish, which we then had to wait another 15 minutes for.  How the heck does the soup come out last?! The worst part about it is that most of the dishes were cold. \\n\\nRather than serving us dishes as they were ready, it was obvious they waited or forgot about our order for a very long time.\\n\\nWe mentioned our frustration to the waitress in a nice way and she said the kitchen was backed up. Then management pops up while we are still waiting for some of our food and asking how is everything.  We mention having some issues with the wait and he makes a snarky comment rather than apologizing or trying to make things a bit better. We weren't at all rude but he handled it all very badly. \\n\\nI think the popularity of the restaurant has made management think that it's ok to treat people badly and that they can afford to lose a few customers. I was appalled and will never go back.\\n\\nIt was one of the worst evenings we've had in a long time. We can't suggest anything other than just avoid the place until they work out the service kinks unless you are in the mood to take the risk of really bad and rude service.   \n",
