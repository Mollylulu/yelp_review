7904,The caller was obnoxious.  He tried to be funny but wasn't.  Then a corner group was clapping after each round was also annoying.  I hope the callers just do their job of calling numbers and not try to be comedians.
946,This place is the bomb . com!!! Every time i go in there i get something new. And eveytime the flavors do not dissapoint. However i do wish that the non blended drinks could be a little colder when they are served. The straws are also sort if hard to open but other then that i love this place.
3970,"Where do I begin.... I love the north park location and thought south side would be the same. Over the last few times I've been, the service and food gets worse. So many mess ups and attitudes it makes me not want to be around there anymore. Tonight was a whole new thing. My boyfriend and I went in for a late night snack and were greeted with snark. No attention for 15 minutes and then we were able to order. When we ordered our food the bartender asked with? Without any explanation, as if we knew the menu, and then attitude. We were surrounded by attractive women at the bar who held the bartenders attention the entire time we were there. Our food came and he handed it to us the check and then stood there until we paid but never once made sure we were good or our food was ok. I do love this place but apparently only the north park location knows how to treat consumers like people. The bartender tonight needs to be fired. I've given this particular place more than enough shots but I will not be returning."
